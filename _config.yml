  Hi, my name is Christopher Göttfert and I'm currently working as a research assistant at the Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) and Psychology of intelligent interactive systems (PIIS) Group at the University of Würzburg.  
  I work in the [HiAvA](https://www.hci.uni-wuerzburg.de/projects/hiava/) Project, which focuses on digital participation in social XR environments. The project is developing and evaluating different solutions for markerless tracking of bodies and faces, as well as participation via different devices.  
  My research focuses on various locomotion techniques as well as the effect on other participants within a social XR. 
  
  Previously, I studied Human-Computer Systems and Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Würzburg, completed an internship as a software developer in VR/AR at the Audi Production Lab and worked as a student employee at TecAlliance in the field of AR development and Machine Learning.

          HiAvA enables a quality leap for diverse collaborative and communicative XR environments of a future cyberspace and allows everyday participation in social VR applications even with limited hardware equipment. The project will develop and evaluate solutions for non-contact tracking of bodies and faces. HiAvA will enable participation in natural social interactions in XR environments, whether user:s use a VR headset, tablet, smartphone, or laptop to participate.
          My responsibilities lie in the development of the platform as well as the impact research of various social XR factors.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
